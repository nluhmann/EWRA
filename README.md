# EWRA - Edge-Weighted Reconstruction integrating aDNA Assembly graph

The EWRA algorithm computes a parsimonious reconstruction of marker adjacencies minimizing the Single-Cut-or-Join (SCJ) distance along a given phylogenetic tree, including the information provided by an assembly graph of ancient DNA (aDNA) data at one internal node of the tree.

## Requirements

The complete pipeline can be run with the provided bash-script. Additionally, the following programs are required:

* FPSAC
* python + networkx
* blast
